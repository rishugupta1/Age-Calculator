# Age-Calculator
## Project Description

The Age Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their age based on their date of birth. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to easily determine their age in years, months, and days.

### Features

- **User Input**: Users can input their date of birth using a date picker.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Instant Calculation**: The age is calculated instantly as the user selects their date of birth.
- **Clear Display**: The calculated age is displayed clearly in years, months, and days.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Adds styling to make the application visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for calculating the age based on the input date.

### How It Works

1. **Date Input**: Users select their date of birth from the date picker input field.
2. **Calculate Age**: When the date is selected, JavaScript functions calculate the age by comparing the selected date with the current date.
3. **Display Result**: The result is displayed on the screen, showing the user's age in years, months, and days.

### Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for age calculation.
### Future Enhancements

- **Validation**: Add input validation to ensure the selected date is not in the future.
- **Error Handling**: Provide user feedback for invalid inputs.
- **Additional Features**: Add features like calculating the age on different planets or more precise age calculation in hours and minutes.
